# RandomStringSynth

This app uses the Web Audio API and Tone.js to create pitch/rhythm patterns corresponding to strings input by user.

This app is limited in scope and meant to provide proof of concept - only the lowercase letters a, b, and c are supported. Each letter plays one note (a - F3, b - C3, c - D3) for the length of a sixteenth note.
